 Tri-County

This uses Johns Hopkins COVID-19 data for the USA cumulative confirmed case data, to date, scaled down to the population of 18,000 for Brewster, Jeff Davis, and Presidio counties (Tri-County) in West Texas. The idea is to use existing data to estimate what the effect will be here. I got tired of reading the news headlines, which used absolute numbers with little meaning (like the way stock market ups and downs are reported), so decided this was a way to address that. This is updated with more recent data every few days. You can view by clicking on the link, or download the accompanying zipfile that contains all three pdf files.

There are two other files with sample graphs, to help get a feel what these distributions look like, and also to appreciate how this disease is progressing at different phases and rates in various countries. These have been put on a per capita basis whenever possible, which is more meaningful than simply absolute numbers. One is global, the other contains Texas and other points of interest. Depending on your browser or device, you may need to go a tab that says "View Code" or "Jump to File" to see these files.

Finally one more file that describes in more detail what the Ro number is.
