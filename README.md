This uses Johns Hopkins COVID-19 data for the USA cumulative confirmed case data, to date. Most browsers will show a link called "View Files" or "View code" that leads to the files. Your browser will show an image of each file. but any links will not operate. If you want to access a link, just download the pdf file for each file, and open the link from there. Data is scaled to the population of 18,000 for Brewster, Jeff Davis, and Presidio counties (Tri-County) in West Texas, for comparative purposes. The idea is to use existing data to estimate what the effect will be here. This is updated with more recent data every few days. 

There are three graph files and two commentary files that supplement each other. "Local" pertains to Tri-County and USA.
