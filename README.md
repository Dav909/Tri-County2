# Tri-County
 Tri-County

This uses Johns Hopkins COVID-19 data for the USA cumulative confirmed case data, to date, scaled down to the population of 18,000 for Brewster, Jeff Davis, and Presidio counties (Tri-County) in West Texas. The idea is to use existing data to estimate what the effect will be here, particularly in terms of medical care. This is updated with more recent data every few days. You can view by clicking on the link, or download the accompanying Acrobat pdf file.

There are two other files with sample graphs, to help get a feel what these distributions look like, and also to appreciate how this disease is progressing at different phases and rates in various countries. One is global, the other contains Texas points of interest and New York City. If you are on a phone, you need to go to tab that says "View Code" or "Jump to File" to see these files.
