This is Johns Hopkins COVID-19 data for the USA (minus NYC) cumulative confirmed case data, to date, scaled down to the population of 16,000 for Brewster, Jeff Davis, and Presidio counties (Tr-County) in West Texas. The idea is to use existing data to estimate what the effect will be here, particularly in terms of medical care.
