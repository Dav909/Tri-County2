 Tri-County

This uses Johns Hopkins COVID-19 data for the USA cumulative confirmed case data, to date. Most browsers will show a link called "View Files" or "View code" that leads to the files. Your browser will show an image of each file, but any links in them will not operate. If you want to access a link, just download the pdf file (Acrobat) for each file, and open the link from within the pdf. Sometimes zooming in on an image in a browser isn't so good, but most browsers have "View as image" button that will take care of that, right click on a mouse.  Data is scaled to the population of 18,000 for Brewster, Jeff Davis, and Presidio counties (Tri-County) in West Texas for comparative purposes. The idea is to use existing data to estimate what the effect will be here. This is updated with more recent data every few days. 

There are three graph files and two commentary files that supplement each other. "Local" pertains to Tri-County and USA. (Another file has been added later, as supplementary material for a Letter to the Editor discussing what "exponential" really means. This is called "Tri-County example")
