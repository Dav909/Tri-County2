 Tri-County

This uses Johns Hopkins COVID-19 data for the USA and World cumulative confirmed case and death data, to date. Most browsers will show a link called "View Files" or "View code" that leads to the files. Since the epidemic apparently is far from over, I will continue on with this.

Your browser will show an image of each file, but any links in them will not operate. If you want to access a link, just download the pdf file (Acrobat) for each file, and open the link from within the pdf. 

Sometimes zooming in on an image in a browser isn't so good, but most browsers have "View as image" button that will take care of that--it's a right click on a mouse.  

Data is also scaled to the population of 18,000 for Brewster, Jeff Davis, and Presidio counties (Tri-County) in West Texas for comparative purposes. The idea is to use existing data to estimate what the effect will be here comparatively. All the data is updated with more recent data every few days. 

There are four graph files and three commentary files that supplement each other. "Local" pertains to Tri-County and USA. Another file was added later, as supplementary material for a Letter to the Editor discussing what "exponential" really means. This is called "Tri-County example." 

More recently, another file was added commenting on an example of obvious media bias on this subject.
