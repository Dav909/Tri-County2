Data collection by Johns Hopkins ceased on 10 March 2023.

This uses Johns Hopkins COVID-19 data for the USA and World cumulative confirmed case and death data, to date. Most browsers will show a link called "View Files" or "View code" that leads to the files. Since the case counts are becoming less relevant, they likely will be discontinued after this current wave is over. Items relevant to excess deaths will be continued. Curve fits have been discontinued, replaced by moving averages for daily case counts.

Your browser will show an image of each file, but any links in them will not operate. If you want to access a link, just download the pdf file (Acrobat) for each file, and open the link from within the pdf. Lately, the image has been incomplete, but just hit download to see the full document. Not sure why that is happening. This happens with Firefox, works fine with Chrome.

Sometimes zooming in on an image in a browser isn't so good, but most browsers have "View as image" button that will take care of that--it's a right click on a mouse.  

Data is also scaled to the population of 18,000 for Brewster, Jeff Davis, and Presidio counties (Tri-County) in West Texas for comparative purposes. The idea is to use existing data to estimate what the effect will be here comparatively. All the data is updated with more recent data every few days. 

There are four graph files and three commentary files that supplement each other. "Local" pertains to Tri-County and USA. Curve fits are particularly useful now, since many locales do not report numbers daily anymore, so the fit shows the true shape better. Another file was added later, as supplementary material for a Letter to the Editor discussing what "exponential" really means. This is called "Tri-County example." A few are duplicated, but only show the last few weeks worth of data, some with a moving average, some with a curve fit of the recent data with its derivative, in order to show whether daily counts are decreasing or increasing, or not.
